Hello! I&#39;m Axl, I am a furry in the UK who is mostly self taught in the creative 
arts sector. I have taught myself in Art the most, but I&#39;ve also taught myself some 
music stuff. I have a mad love for retro tech, and even made this website on a 
retro machine!</p>
<p align="left">
I&#39;m also a little bit of a gamer, but not that much. I play such games such 
as Nintendo&#39;s Star Fox, 3D Realms&#39; Duke Nukem/Terminal Velocity, ID&#39;s Doom, 
Squaresoft&#39;s Final Fantasy VII and Valve&#39;s Half Life! Did you know that Star Fox 
was the main catalyst for my love of fighter aircrafts and spacecraft? It&#39;s been 
my dream for a long while to fly my own ship like the Arwing.<br>
<br>
In terms of Art, I&#39;ve been drawing for almost as long as I have been alive (Not 
saying it was far from a scribble though!) At around 2018, I was bullied quite a 
lot in school, which induced a depression which led to me stopping art, 
and destroying EVERYTHING that I&#39;ve done. Only a few artworks from this time 
survived.</p>
<p align="left">
A few years later, just before lockdown, I worked up the courage to begin 
doing art again, but under the fluffy alias you see now!<img border="0" src="animshot.gif" width="262" height="103" align="right"> Since my art skills 
were lost over time, I decided to just use the game &quot;Garry&#39;s Mod&quot; to pose Barney 
Calhoun. This was my reference for poses. This would continue for a year or two 
until my laptop broke. This stopped me from doing art for 2 months, as one of 
the main pillars was just swept from underneath. After these 2 months, I 
eventually worked up the courage to learn to stand without this pillar, and I 
learned to pose without the help of Garry&#39;s Mod. The proportions at this 
time still were not great, and they were quite skinny and pointy, but I kept 
going, slowly improving my skills overtime. Some other artists helped me learn 
stuff in recent times too! Great thanks to them!</p>
<p align="left">
In recent times, I have also been getting into story writing. Most of my 
artworks come with stories. People seem to really enjoy the stories I put along 
with artworks. Below is a snippet of a full story I am working on!</p>

While I&#39;m no music professional, I do rarely like to do it as a side hobby. 
While most of my works are just mixes of readily made samples, I do sometimes 
come up with some original compositions. If you want an example, scroll down to 
the bottom of this page and press the &quot;Credits&quot; button. A song that I made 
myself should begin playing. This song was for a long scrapped animation project 
of mine. You can find a W.I.P of where specifically the song was used on my 
YouTube channel.</p>
<p align="left">
In terms of retro tech, I am one hell of a nerd. I have collected several retro 
phones. I&#39;ll be honest, I don&#39;t believe in something becoming obsolete. My main 
phone is still a Samsung SGH-E900 from 2007. I&#39;ve been able to rely on it much 
more than my more modern phone. I have even gotten to grips with the Apple ][ 
and Commodore 64 too. I have previously made a very basic password system for 
both machines. The very machine I made this website on was built in 2004, and 
was the old family PC. It was fully dead and I spent a few years reviving it. 
Going back to the obsolete disbelief, I still use all sorts of &quot;obsolete&quot; things 
to this day! I daily drive and am able to rely on the E900, and the Fujitsu 
Siemens SCALEO P, to this day they still work great. Did you know that I still 
use floppy disks too? My Dell Inspiron 1545 has actually gotten me through my 
work while modern tech failed. I have also proven just how capable &quot;obsolete&quot; 
tech can still be. I have been able to make art on the Apple Macintosh and 
Windows 1.01! </p>
<p align="left">
I also have some knowledge on making maps in the Source Engine (The engine 
Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2 and Garry&#39;s Mod run on). I have been working to 
make a local town I know as it was back in 2011, another local town from 2009, a 
hangout map, and a Mario Kart inspired track.</p>
<p align="left">
Occasionally, I also get into making neat little scripts. For instance, I had 
made a script file that randomly chooses a character of mine for use in upcoming 
artworks! It&#39;s rather simple, but it works!</p>

I also love to preserve things. In recent years, I have specifically taken 
interest into TV archival. I have gathered up a collection of old ITV and BBC 
content. A lot of my research and data is good enough for you to go ahead and 
make your own mock stuff! This ranges from show themes (Such as ITV&#39;s GMTV and 
Daybreak) to Idents, their full audio, and their continuities! This is probably 
fuelled by my love for retro stuff. <br>
<br>
Thanks for being interested in what I do, and thanks for reading!</p>

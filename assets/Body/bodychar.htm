		believe he was the result of illegal experimentation by humans (Using 
		Vionan blood), before he was saved and transported to Viona by Justine. 
		Axl is the leader of the Nightfire Squadron. Unlike most normal wolves,

		is how she met Axl. To this day, nobody knows of her origin. Her jacket

		looking like a mix between a snow leopard and a wolf. Her goo is able to 
		give others the same appearance as her. The process remains a mystery, 
		but can easily be reversed by members of her species (If you decide to 
		reverse in under a month since the initial transformation. If it&#39;s more 
		than a month, it will be&nbsp; permanent.) She is very kind though, and

		person under a specific tree. The person would then wake up back in 
		their own bed. The curse was somehow lifted when she dragged Axl along.

		<br>
		Her tentacles can be used to inject her own goo into someone. Small 
		intakes can cause extreme tiredness, or extreme disorientation, tiny 
		intakes may cause the person to be sent into a relaxed state. larger 
		intakes can cause paralysis, or it can prevent movement in your body

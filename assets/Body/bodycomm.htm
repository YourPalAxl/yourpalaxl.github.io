	<b><i>Current Status: <font color="#00FF00">Open (As of 02/02/2010)</font></i></b></div>

<p align="left"><i><b>Warning:</b></i></p>
<p align="left">If you would like to fill in a slot, please take heed of the 
status. If you feel doubts on whether this has been updated, please do not be 
afraid to message me by any of the given methods. Please refrain from asking 
said question if the last update date is recent (Below a month). Please also 
refrain from nagging for the status (Constant requests for the status in quick 
succession). Doing so may get you temporarily suspended from taking any slots in 
the future.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Please do keep in mind that I:</b></i></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF6600">A: Reserve the right to draw gift art 
for people.</font></b><br>
<br>
I do this out of the goodness of my own heart. Please do not request a gift.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#FF6600">B: Reserve the right to cancel any Commissions, 
Trades*, or requests.</font></b><br>
<br>
If I cancel a commission, I will refund the money or product, if possible. If 
not, I will try my best to find an equivalent, or will try to work on what you 
wanted at a later time. I will also try to refund if you decide to back out**.<br>
<i><font size="2" color="#FF6600">*If your end of a trade has been done, to 
prevent accidental scamming, I will always try to do it at a later date.<br>
**There will not be refunds if the artwork gets completed. Any attempt to 
request a refund after this may come across as a scam attempt. You may then be 
indefinitely suspended from future slot openings.</font></i><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF6600"><b>C: Reserve the right to deny anything at anytime.</b></font></p>
<p align="left">I am obliged to deny any requests, trades, or commissions at any 
time. This has a higher chance of occurring if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You attempt to make a request, trade, or commission during 
	the time there are no slots open.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">What you wanted fails to comply by certain standards 
	(mentioned further down)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">If there are concurrent hardware issues (Such as computer 
	failures)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You are suspended from taking any slots</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You try to do a payment without authorisation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">If I do deny your request, I will try to give a reason as to 
why. If the reason is due to what you want not falling under standards, I will 
give you another chance to have something else.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF6600"><b>D: Suspend people from taking slots, whether it be 
temporary, or indefinitely</b></font><br>
<br>
I will not allow people who are suspended to be able to fill a spot. This could 
happen to you if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You have any sort of repeated attitude</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">What you want constantly fails to fall under standards. I 
	will notice if this is accidental, which will be an exception</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You try to force yourself into the queue. This will result 
	in an immediate and indefinite suspension.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Repeated attempts to pay without authorisation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF6600"><b>E: Contact the relevant authorities If 
your description induces extreme concern, or is not acceptable by law.</b></font><br>
<br>
I am always allowed to contact the relevant authorities should what you want 
cause me to question your safety, or the safety of others.<br>
<br>
I will also do it should your request fall under unlawful terms.<br>
<br>
Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Sexual Acts Including Underage Characters (NSFW is still not 
	accepted at all by me)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Zoophilia</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Terrorism</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Description of any crime in extreme detail (One would assume 
	this to be experience-derived detail)</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b><i>My standards:</i></b></p>
<p align="left">These are the themes of drawing that comply with my standards.<br>
Here are the themes I will accept:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Wholesome art (Such as cuddles etc)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Sonic The Hedgehog</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Transfur/Transformation (Within certain limits)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">General Furry Art</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;Suit TFs&quot; (Within Limits)</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">There is a good chance I&#39;m missing something here. If it&#39;s not 
listed then don&#39;t be afraid to ask if it&#39;s OK. You should still take heed of the 
above rules though.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>What I will not draw:</i></b></p>
<p align="left">I will never, under any circumstances, draw the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>The ones mentioned further up</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Vore</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Inflation</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>NSFW (Not Safe For Work)</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Gore</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Drawings that have a certain parts of a character as the 
	main focus</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Politically motivated artworks (I&#39;m here to escape from 
	damn politics!)</i></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Working Days</b><br>
<br>
To help prevent me from getting overworked I may only work on agreed 
commissions, trades and requests on certain days. Outside of these working days, 
I will take a break until the new &quot;week&quot; begins. Only personal art will be 
worked on at this time. It will also help contain my on-going distraction 
issues.<br>
<br>
These working days are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Wednesday-Friday: May be Inconsistent. Depends on the day. 
	(College)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Monday and Tuesday: I will work on them if I have the 
	energy.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Saturday and Sunday: Personal art only.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Anonymity</b></p>
<p align="left">At your request, I will keep the art agreement a secret. This is 
OK if you do not want the artwork to be seen by the public eye. Requesting 
Anonymity will prevent the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Me posting the result to any online platforms (Though I will 
	always ask before doing this regardless)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Any information on the artwork getting outside of the chat.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As the topic suggests, I&#39;ll do my best to keep you anonymous. 
You are free to ask me to post it, but I will put &quot;Artwork for an anonymous 
user&quot; instead of &quot;Artwork for (Your Screen name)&quot;</p>

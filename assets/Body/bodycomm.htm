<p align="left">This policy (Alternatively called a TOS / 
&quot;Terms Of Service&quot;) outlines the rules and expectations governing all art and 
commission services provided by me&quot;, Axl Woodland <i><b>(&quot;Artist&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;My&quot;, 
&quot;Me&quot;).</b></i> By going ahead with requesting a commission, <b><i>&quot;You&quot;</i></b> 
(the <b><i>&quot;Client&quot;</i></b>) have read through and agree to the policy 
(Alternatively called a TOS / &quot;Terms Of Service&quot;) below. This agreement is 
designed to help maintain a positive, clear, professional and respectful working 
relationship between me (the artist) and you (the client). </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><span style="background-color: #FF6600">
<b><i>Expect</i></b></span><i><b><span style="background-color: #FF6600"> be

<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; padding-left: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px">
	<p align="left">If you would like to fill in a slot, please take heed of the 
status. If you feel doubts on whether this has been updated, please do not be 
afraid to message me by any of the given methods. Please refrain from asking 
said question if the last update date is recent (Below a month). Please also 
refrain from nagging for the status (Constant requests for the status in quick 
succession). Doing so may get you temporarily suspended from taking any slots in 
the future.</p></div>
<div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; padding-left: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px">
	<p align="left">The speed of the commission solely depends on:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p align="left">My Motivation and/or feelings (Huge Factor)</p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="left">Things that may be going on in my life</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p align="left">Therefore, It is quite literally impossible for me to give 
	any sort of completion predictions. Please <b><i>DO 
	NOT ASK</i></b>.</p></div>
<p align="left"><i><b>Please do keep in mind that I:</b></i></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF6600">A: Reserve the right to draw gift art

<br><b><font color="#FF6600">B: Reserve the right to cancel any Commissions, 
Trades*, or requests.</font></b><br><br>If I cancel a commission, I will refund the money or product, if possible. If 
not, I will try my best to find an equivalent, or will try to work on what you 
wanted at a later time. I will also try to refund if you decide to back out**.<br>
<i><font size="2" color="#FF6600">*If your end of a trade has been done, to 
prevent accidental scamming, I will always try to do it at a later date.<br>**There will not be refunds if the artwork gets completed. Any attempt to 
request a refund after this may come across as a scam attempt. You may then be 
indefinitely suspended from future slot openings.</font></i><br><br>
<font color="#FF6600"><b>C: Reserve the right to deny anything at anytime.</b></font></p>
<p align="left">I am obliged to deny any requests, trades, or commissions at any 
time. This has a higher chance of occurring if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You attempt to make a request, trade, or commission during 
	the time there are no slots open.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">What you wanted fails to comply by certain standards 
	(mentioned further down)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">If there are concurrent hardware issues (Such as computer 
	failures)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You are suspended from taking any slots</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You try to do a payment without authorisation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">If I do deny your request, I will try to give a reason as to 
why. If the reason is due to what you want not falling under standards, I will 
give you another chance to have something else.<br><br><font color="#FF6600"><b>D: Suspend people from taking slots, whether it be 
temporary, or indefinitely</b></font><br><br>I will not allow people who are suspended to be able to fill a spot. This could 
happen to you if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You have any sort of repeated attitude</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">What you want constantly fails to fall under standards. I 
	will notice if this is accidental, which will be an exception</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You try to force yourself into the queue. This will result 
	in an immediate and indefinite suspension.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Repeated attempts to pay without authorisation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF6600"><b>E: Contact the relevant authorities If 
your description induces extreme concern, or is not acceptable by law.</b></font><br>
<br>I am always allowed to contact the relevant authorities should what you want 
cause me to question your safety, or the safety of others.<br><br>I will also do it should your request fall under unlawful terms.<br>
<br>Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Sexual Acts Including Underage Characters (NSFW is still not 
	accepted at all by me)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Zoophilia (Sexual Acts Involving 
	Actual Animals)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Terrorism</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Description of any crime in extreme detail (One would assume 
	this to be experience-derived detail)</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><i><font size="2">All characters depicted in my artworks are 
of a mature age. Minors are never involved. If this character looks like a 
minor, I will instantly deny. If this character originates from a game, TV show 
or elsewhere, I will try to track down some voice lines of said character if I 
am unable to determine age based on looks</font><font color="#FFB888" size="2">.</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><b><i>My standards:</i></b></p>
<p align="left">These are the themes of drawing that comply with my standards.<br>Here are the themes I will accept:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Wholesome art (Such as cuddles etc)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Sonic The Hedgehog</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Transfur/Transformation (Within certain limits)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">General Furry Art</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;Suit Transformation&quot; (Within Limits)</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">There is a good chance I&#39;m missing something here. If it&#39;s not 
listed then don&#39;t be afraid to ask if it&#39;s OK. You should still take heed of the 
above rules though.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>What I will not draw:</i></b></p>
<p align="left">I will never, under any circumstances, draw the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>The ones mentioned further up</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Vore</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Inflation</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>NSFW (Not Safe For Work)</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Gore</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Drawings that have a certain parts of a character as the 
	main focus</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><i>Politically motivated artworks (I&#39;m here to escape from 
	damn politics!)</i></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Working Days</b><br><br><font color="#FFB888">To help prevent me from getting overworked I may only work on agreed 
commissions, trades and requests on certain days, under certain shifts.</font> Outside of these working 
times, 
I will take a break until the next Monday. Only personal art will be 
worked on at this time. It will also help contain my on-going distraction 
issues and motivation.<br><br><font color="#FFB888">These working days are 
Monday to Friday. On Saturday and Sunday, no commissions will be worked on at 
all. On Monday to Friday, I will only work on commissions during certain shifts. 
Currently, these shifts go on from ~10:30 AM to 10 PM. These are subject to 
change, however. I will update clients and this website as soon as possible 
following a change to my schedule. Please be aware that I may not work on 
commissions depending on my emotion / mental state.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b>Anonymity</b></p>
<p align="left">At your request, I will keep the art agreement a secret. This is 
OK if you do not want the artwork to be seen by the public eye. Requesting 
Anonymity will prevent the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Me posting the result to any online platforms (Though I will 
	always ask before doing this regardless)</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Any information on the artwork getting outside of
	<font color="#FFB888">our</font> chat.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As the topic suggests, I&#39;ll do my best to keep you anonymous. 
You are free to ask me to post it, but I will put &quot;Artwork for an anonymous 
user&quot; instead of &quot;Artwork for (Your Screen name)&quot;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Usage Of Artworks</b></p>
<p align="left">If this commission contains any of my characters, vehicles 
and/or designs, external usage will be strictly prohibited. Otherwise, you are 
free to use the artwork. As long as you comply with the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You MUST be the client that commissioned the artwork.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">My signature must not be defaced, hidden, or covered in any 
	manner. This includes user interfaces. <i>If the location of the signature 
	is in a place where it makes usage difficult, please request me to move it. 
	You should also provide a screenshot of where you are trying to use it. This 
	can greatly help with fast repositioning.</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">If possible, please give credit in text somewhere.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFB888">
<p align="left"><b>Policy against &quot;Roblox&quot; characters.</b></p>
<p align="left">Roblox characters will usually be denied. This is due to their 
block-like limbs, and their usually simplistic / minimal features (such as face 
graphics.). You will also be taking risks, as I will be strongly debating 
whether you will even be allowed to continue, as I may start questioning your 
age and. For a higher chance of your Roblox 
character getting accepted, please make sure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You have an actual art reference of said character</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The character is original, and doesn&#39;t use popular/usual 
	additions from the Roblox store.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">You make sure to not send screenshots of your Roblox 
	character as references</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Your Roblox character is not simplistic/minimal in design.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Your Roblox character, and it&#39;s addons, can&#39;t be associated 
	with Roblox by the standard viewer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The attempted usage of the default Roblox characters, including 
the original &quot;Noob&quot; design will be met with instant denial, and an immediate 
(Possibly indefinite) suspension. This is because I will definitely assume you to be a 
minor.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Change Limits<br>
<br>
</b>If, during the commission process, you come with a change suggestion, please 
let me know as soon as possible. Useless suggestions such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;Be sure to clean it up&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;Move this (small line) slightly&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;Redraw the line art&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;Add Colour&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;Be sure to add [part of an artwork that was already 
	discussed and going to be added]&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">&quot;I don&#39;t like how you shaded, do it differently&quot;</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Will be ignored. While I want the artwork to be perfect for you, 
these kind of useless suggestions can damage my motivation, and can also damage 
the final outcome of the artwork. This also links to another change related 
topic. Change limits have now been imposed. With each update I give you, You 
have a maximum of 5 suggestions to give, so please think hard before giving 
suggestions. If the (part of the) artwork is completed, You will be allowed one 
last suggestion. Your suggestions may also be ignored if deemed inappropriate. 
Examples include, but are not limited to suggesting a heavy change or extra 
addition when the artwork is complete, or in the final stages of creation. 
Excessive changes can lead to a decline in the quality of the final outcome, and 
may drastically increase creation time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Postponing<br>
<br>
</b>As I only work on one artwork at a time, users are required to respond in a 
timely manner. If I require your response, you have a maximum of 48 hours to 
respond. Failing to do so will result in your artwork getting postponed. This 
consequence means that I will move on to someone else and not bother with your 
artwork until the artwork for the person that I had moved on to gets completed.<u>
<b><i>THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR ARTWORK HAS BEEN CANCELLED. </i></b></u>Unless I 
finish the next person&#39;s artwork, the postponing will remain regardless of 
whether you finally decide to respond. Exceptions do apply, however. If 
something occurs (or is planned to occur) that will impact your ability to 
contact me for more than 48 hours, please let me know.</p>

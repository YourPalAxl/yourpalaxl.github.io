Date: 27th May 2024</font></i></p>
<p>Urgent Help Required: I have lost some of my artworks, they have been missing 
for years now. May I have some help in retrieving them? They are not present on 
any of my accounts or devices. I searched the Information Superhighway far and 
wide, nothing. One I distinctly remember was my sona (Axl) as a Black Mesa 
Security Guard (Back when i still used Calhoun for posing) If you have a copy of 
ANY of my old artworks, do you mind shooting me an email? Thanks. Check Comm. 
Info for my email. If you are not sure as to whether I have an artwork, be sure 
to check the art section. I will post EVERY artwork that I have. </p>

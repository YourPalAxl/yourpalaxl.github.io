<p><i><font face="Arial Black" color="#FF6600">Going back to DVDs - Entry 
Date: 07th June 2025</font></i></p>
<p>I have finally decided to go back to using DVDs. The truth is, that I have <i>
always</i> hated the concept of streaming services. By using them, you are 
contributing to the dystopian future where you own nothing, and that's the problem. I, 
like some, have decided to stop using streaming services all together! (Not that 
I used them in the first place anyways.)</p>
<p>Unlike with streaming services, these scumbag companies are unable to take 
your physical media from you. With streaming services, every single service has 
the ability to take away media from their platforms, even if you bought and 
downloaded it. This can very much result in lost media. With DVDs and other 
physical media, they can't do that. The disc is yours.</p>
<p>You don't need internet either. So theoretically, even in the event of global 
economic and civil collapse, you can still watch your movies! So far, I have 4 
DVDs in my collection. Not much, I know, but we all start from somewhere. The 
following DVDs are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Independence Day</li>
	<li>Top Gun (Special Edition)</li>
	<li>White House Down</li>
	<li>Sonic The Hedgehog 3</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, some movie makers are kind enough to still distribute even 
the newest movies (Sonic The Hedgehog 3) onto physical. Before anyone complains 
&quot;Ohhhhh, but DVD is less quality than streaming!&quot;, don't even start that crap. 
People who can't even lay a finger on &quot;ancient and obsolete&quot; tech disgust me. As 
far as I'm concerned, as long as you can still distinguish people's faces, and 
what's on the screen. It's more than good enough, and guess what? With DVD, you 
can! Just use genuine DVDs instead of making or obtaining bootleg or burned 
copies. It's those things that worsen the quality. You can get a more than 
enjoyable experience from DVDs.</p>
<p>If you're worried that your old (but gold) DVD hardware won't be able to 
understand newer discs. Don't worry. I've been able to watch Sonic The Hedgehog 
3 on my Fujistu Siemens SCALEO P from 2004, and that film came out just last 
year! If you're worried that the discs will just stop working on you, then it's 
on you. As long as you handle them properly, and not just leave them at your 
ass, they should be fine! If you're so worried, just handle it with extreme 
care. Always keep the cases handy, and don't keep them in spindles. Don't 
carelessly drop or force the disc into the case or the disc tray. If the case 
gets damaged to the point where the disc keeps falling out of the slot, don't 
just leave it in there. at least get a little bit of blue-tack and put it on the 
label (NOT DATA) side of the disc! Avoid force spinning the disc when it's in 
the tray or in the case.</p>
<p>I know of a YouTube channel known as &quot;Jiga Tech&quot; that had a burned copy of a 
Windows XP install disk. He decided to bury it outside for a year. A few days 
ago, he decided to dig it back up. After a clean, he had tested it. Windows XP 
had installed completely fine. This goes to show just how surprisingly strong 
optical media can be. Heck, newer readers and burners are getting more 
sophisticated now. The daily driver DVD-RW drive from 2014 that I bought for £3 
was able to read my old and bad condition PS2 discs of &quot;Time Crisis II&quot; and 
&quot;Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX 2&quot;. Not only could the drive read through the scratches 
and filth, I was also able to play the games using PCSX2.</p>
<p>What streaming will never give us, is EXTRAS! My special edition of Top Gun 
has over 3 hours of extras. So much stuff that it required *2 DISCS*! My newest 
film on DVD is Sonic 3. Even that has extras, that gives insight on behind the 
scenes stuff. It even has interviews with the actors, such as Keanu Reaves. 
Another thing lost with streaming is the art of DVD root menus! Sure, modern 
DVDs might just have a static image as the background with music, but it all has 
their own design! Older DVDs is where the true menu art is. Take Top Gun for 
instance. That has entire animation sequences when going into the menu, going 
between menus and starting the film! Just to give that little bit of excitement 
before the movie starts!</p>
<p>Back then some movies had collaborations to give the owner goodies. A family 
member's old copy of Superman Returns still contains an advertisement for the 
now defunct phone carrier &quot;Orange UK&quot;. This shows their collaboration, where 
Orange would give you Superman Returns java games, wallpapers, screensavers and 
ringtones.<br>
<br>
A massive ramble, I know, but come on! Come to the dark side! We have <i>actual 
ownership!</i> Dump these scumbag streaming services. Give physical another 
chance! Heck, if you're a kid who grew up with streaming, It's still never too 
late to start. See how things were! (Also this place is a no-child site, so 
please leave.)</p>

<p><i><font face="Arial Black" color="#FF6600">Making a private file sharing 
network - Entry 
Date: 14th June 2025</font></i></p>
<p>So I have been thinking, and after some consideration, I have decided. I'm 
going to make me a private network for sharing files between computers. You may 
be wondering why I couldn't just use my normal internet-connected main router. 
The truth is, that despite the fact my family doesn't know much about networking 
or the router, I still don't trust them, or the router enough to share files 
through. Call me a privacy freak, but I don't want them to accidentally find 
something, or end have my files accessed or sent to another person on the 
network.</p>
<p>I currently use my Android phone to execute this task, but as you would 
expect, it's one heck of a battery guzzler. The phone's battery is already on 
its last legs, so it can't afford to keep on doing this. As this planned router 
will not be needing internet access, and as it won't be plugged in constantly, I 
have opted to find an old and small router from eBay. At least I will be proving 
that old tech can still be usable, right?</p>
<p>I have decided that the router I will buy will be an in-box Orange LiveBox. 
The thing is quite small, which is perfect for my case. I have researched about 
this router, and though I never found exact specifications, I did see an eBay 
listing that had the standard-sized Orange LiveBox set up CD right up against 
the unit. I decided to use this as reference and got my own standard-sized CD. I 
then did some looking and figured out that the Orange LiveBox is pretty close to 
that of my sketchbook.</p>
<p>If you are worried about internet security, the LiveBox will not be 
constantly plugged in and running 24/7. I will also never give the LiveBox 
access to the internet. Internet is not needed for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>LAN File Sharing</li>
	<li>LAN Web Server</li>
	<li>LAN Gaming</li>
	<li>LAN Server Hosting</li>
	<li>LAN File Server</li>
	<li>LAN Media Server</li>
</ul>
<p>As an extra precaution, when the LiveBox is in use, all connected computers 
will be fully disconnected from the internet and Bluetooth. Theoretically, 
having no Internet communication could give the router a tiny bit more room to 
work.</p>

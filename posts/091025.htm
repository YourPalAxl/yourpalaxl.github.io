<p><i><font face="Arial Black" color="#FF6600">I got an iPod, and you should 
too. - Entry Date:&nbsp; 9th October 2025</font></i></p>
<p>So, after a long while of resisting the urge, I finally decided to get an 
iPod!<img border="0" src="assets/ipod4g.jpg" width="309" height="412" align="right"> 
My specific iPod is a 4th Generation Monochrome iPod classic! I had purchased it 
on an eBay auction for £33. It was listed as for being for a for parts only 
device. It had arrived yesterday. It was in far better condition than I 
initially imagined. While, it was initially displaying the dead/sad iPod screen 
initially, I was somehow able to get the hard drive working again by re-plugging 
it. Beforehand, it would spin up and down approximately 4 times before 
displaying the dead iPod screen.</p>
<p>You likely know of the recent increase in the iPod and similar devices being 
bought. People are finally starting to realise that with streaming services, you 
own nothing. People are realising that you are no longer in control. You may be 
laughing now, but just imagine. You deciding to listen to your favourite song 
while out on a walk, or while doing work, but uh oh! Where&#39;s it gone? You can&#39;t 
seem to find it at all! You put it in playlists, you even check the other 
streaming platforms, but it&#39;s gone! It&#39;s like you awoken in an alternate reality 
where said song never existed! Seems like a snippet of fiction, right? Wrong. 
Hell, maybe some scumbag government will cause the streaming service that you 
use to give over your personal identification just to be able to listen to any 
song. <i><font size="1" color="#C0C0C0">(*cough cough* UK. *cough cough*)</font></i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is now the dystopian future we live in. All because 
humans are blinded by convenience. Streaming has ripped away our control. 
Streaming has ripped away our ownership of music. We let it happen willingly. 
We&#39;re now required to be online constantly just to play music. Your experience 
always gets ruined by adverts. These platforms are also getting social media 
jammed into them. It makes things very difficult for those who want to get away. 
These platforms are also crammed full of soulless algorithm generated slop.</p>
<p>The iPod however, was from a time where most tech were still user-oriented. 
The iPod will happily work outside. The iPod can still do basic functions 
without internet. The iPod doesn&#39;t have adverts shoved in your face. You won&#39;t 
get soulless artificial slop slapped in your face. The iPod doesn&#39;t control how 
many times you can skip. The iPod isn&#39;t a brick with flashing colours, constant 
notifications, and distractions. It helps you get away. It helps you focus. The 
iPod isn&#39;t an addictive drug. People have had enough. People are finally seeing 
through the lies of convenience. This is why people are going back to older 
phones. This is why people are jumping back to iPods.</p>
<p>Unfortunately however, especially among the older generations, some hardware 
within an iPod (Notably the hard drive and the battery) have a tendency to not 
be able to survive the test of time. Unfortunately you can&#39;t just plug the iPod 
in and expect things to work, even if you are lucky enough to find a boxed one. 
You will have to make some internal replacements. Depending on who you are, this 
may be a bumpy road, or it may be a smooth one. Either way the reward of the 
learning curve, experience, and unrestricted listening will be worth it. As you 
were the one that fixed up this device, regardless of where you bought it, you 
will actually gain a personal connection to the device. Fixing an modding an 
iPod, just like a car, will give you the sense that this is <i>YOUR </i>iPod. 
This is <i>YOUR </i>iPod that you had this experience with.</p>
<p>One of the most notable modifications you should make with your iPod before 
daily driving it, is flash modding. Not only will it replace that worn out 
unreliable hard drive, but others around you will no longer be subject to the 
constant whirring and clicking of said hard drive. Flash storage is usually 
faster than hard drives of this vintage, this means that your iPod could run 
faster! Flash storage usually requires less power than a hard drive too, so it 
could extend your battery&#39;s lifetime too. On that topic, it&#39;s also best that you 
replace your iPod&#39;s battery. This is because with time, and use, rechargeable 
batteries can degrade massively. This can result in significantly less play 
times, or it some cases, the complete inability for the battery to hold even a 
tiny bit of charge.</p>
<p>The methods and difficulty of opening, operating on and testing iPods differ 
depending on the model. I recommend you do some research and look at guides 
before tearing open or purchasing parts for your iPod. As with all tech, take 
utmost caution when operating on the internals. Always expect a ribbon cable to 
be hiding in a stupid place before opening something. It&#39;s better to give it a 
shot, but if you know that you can&#39;t do it, or if you can&#39;t step out of your 
comfort zone, someone you know might be able to do it for you. Just be sure they 
actually know what they&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide, I wish you the best of luck in your iPod listening 
endeavours! As of writing, at 01:55 AM, the last part of the flash mod for my 
iPod will be arriving later on! Be sure to check back at the news section soon 
for an update on how my experience goes!</p>

A Warning... - Entry

<p align="justify"><b><i><span style="background-color: #0000FF">Update (2nd 
March 2025): </span></i></b><i><span style="background-color: #0000FF">So when I 
written this back in November, I was angry over the situation and my judgement 
was clouded as a result. I unintentionally pinned the blame entirely on &quot;Person 
1&quot;. Some recent occurrences had come to light from &quot;Person 1&quot; and it had caused 
me to have to look back over everything and I realised. It wasn't one person, it 
was two. Some of the occurrences noted here were never committed by &quot;Person 1&quot; 
it was actually &quot;Person 2&quot;. To make matters worse, &quot;Person 2&quot; allegedly was 
behind most of it. &quot;Person 2&quot; was apparently with &quot;Person 1&quot; in person, and was 
allegedly using physical violence to force them. I will highlight the acts that 
were actually committed by &quot;Person 2&quot; </span>
<span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #FF0000">LIKE THIS.</span></i></p>
<p>First of all, I just wanted to address an issue that's been going on for a 
bit. It mostly started around the time I created the character &quot;Iris&quot;. She was 
gaining some positive attention at first, loads of people liked the creativity 
in the character's design. Overtime, however, things have gotten... Weird, to 
say the least.<br>
<br>
First of all, I started hearing that people have been downloading my drawings 
containing Iris. For a while, I thought nothing of it, thinking that they just 
liked the artwork and were downloading my other artworks too. Then overtime, I 
come to the dark realisation that none of my other art was being downloaded. 
Only artwork of specific characters, mostly Iris.<br>
I tried my best to ignore it, until I started receiving messages saying how they 
really like Iris and how I &quot;got to designing Iris before they did&quot;. That's utter 
nonsense. What makes this whole ordeal worse is that through the end of 
yesterday, and into the early hours of today, I had someone message me about how 
much they liked Iris. To a disheartening extent.</p>
<p><br>
They started by nagging for me to make more art with Iris. While this may not 
seem bad, it gets worse. They suddenly started acting all depressed, and me 
being me tried to lift their spirits. Then they started mentioning Iris more.
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-color: #FF0000">
They then said that Iris is &quot;All that they've ever wanted.&quot; and that I beat them 
to making Iris.</span> They then nagged to draw art of Iris, to which I denied, 
because I was at this point already having worries. They then started 
guilt-tripping and said that they can't stop thinking about Iris. From this 
point, their language started to get more and more obsessive. Constantly 
repeating things like how they can't get Iris out of their head, and they 
they've been thinking about her constantly since I created her. Soon, he 
directly admits to having an obsession with Iris.
<span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; background-color: #FF0000">
They then said that Iris is &quot;The character of his dreams&quot; and that if he could 
&quot;Go back in time to create her or have a way of getting her&quot;.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-color: #FF0000">
After confessing to their obsession, they even had the audacity to ask to buy 
ownership of the character.</span> If anything, buying the character will add 
fuel to the fire, it won't extinguish it. Then they started guilt tripping even 
more. They stopped texting at right before 6 in the morning. I then go to sleep, 
and then at around 10 PM tonight, I had someone message me asking for a trade, 
saying that they will make multiple art pieces in return. I politely declined, 
but still asked what they were thinking. The person then said about making a 
character resembling Iris. I talked to one of my good friends about it, and we 
both came to the realisation that this third person was a possible relay.</p>
<p><br>
I just wanted to say that guilt tripping will never work. Using people to get 
art from me will also never work. Admitting an obsession will not guilt-trip me 
into giving you a character, or art of that character. It's for your own good. 
Lastly, do not EVER think about buying ownership of any of my characters. They 
are NOT for sale, and they will never will.<br>
This arrogant behaviour has actually made me uncomfortable, it has angered me, 
and it has made me even regret creating her sometimes.</p>

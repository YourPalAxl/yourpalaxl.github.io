<p>If you've been on this website before the 25th, you'll have definitely 
noticed that things have changed. How things are that much more... retro. I'll 
explain.<br>
<br>
For one, I really like what the old internet was like. The webpage was 
completely yours to design what you want, how you want. Now on this disgusting 
modern internet, you're bound by website builders that hinder that creativity 
and force you to be boring and modern. Modernity sucks!&nbsp; Do away with those 
modern typefaces, layouts, colours, flat logos, to heck with it all! Creativity 
and sparkles all the way! Put in all the GIFs! Put in all the web buttons! Let's 
just go back and take things easy, right? </p>
<p>Secondly, I'll be honest. My method of building the &quot;Watercolour Midnight&quot; 
and &quot;Citrus&quot; versions of my website were not that great. The software I used to 
make them was Microsoft Office Publisher 2007, using the built-in web creation 
tools. Recently, I realised just how clunky these tools were. Sure, it gave you 
the power to create the webpage you could before only dream of. I, however, 
found that these tools were actually quite clunky and unstable. For one, it 
would for some reason slap HTML comments all over the HTML file OF THE CODE, 
making the webpage downright impossible to modify yourself. Another reason is 
that as your site develops overtime, and you add elements, the program and the 
site begin to break. In my experience, I had a MASSIVELY slow Publisher that 
took over a second just to change it's zoom unit. I had also encountered the 
webpage absolutely freaking out on some compiles for no reason. Some buttons 
also stretched down to the earth's core! Another problem was that the asset 
folder would always be unorganised. The inability to modify the HTML easily 
makes organisation very difficult. </p>
<p>So I decided to stick with Microsoft FrontPage 2003 on Windows XP instead! 
With it, I made the &quot;Citrus Retro&quot; theme, the very website you see before you!</p>

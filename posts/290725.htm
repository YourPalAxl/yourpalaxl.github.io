<p>Hello.<br>
You may have heard about how the UK has set up a new law regarding the Online 
Safety Act. Together with Ofcom, they have made it a requirement for most 
websites to require the sending of IDs and/or other documents. They say that 
this is &quot;To Provide Protection For Children&quot;. I personally think that it's 
complete bullshit. Everyone can tell that this is just them wanting to rip away 
the very little privacy we have left. They just want to use the 
fuck-first-ask-later parents giving their kids unrestricted iPads to shut them 
up as an excuse. This isn't protection. This is fucking censorship. I've 
actually heard people starting to compare the UK to <i>certain other locked down 
countries.</i></p>
<p>This Is absolutely disgusting. I personally think that the internet is done 
for. I personally think this is going to cause trouble in my case. The sites I 
post my art to have some adult content posted there. So those sites are possibly 
in the firing line. I already have trouble accessing these sites already. I 
require the use of a VPN just to access them. While now, nothing has happened 
yet, I have heard rumours that the government is also planning on cracking down 
on the usage of VPNs. On the petition to repeal it, they actually responded 
saying that they do not intend on repealing the law, and are doubling down on 
it.</p>
<p>This is most likely going to fuck over my art stuff, and I'll likely soon 
have to say goodbye. So if one day, I were to suddenly disappear from online, I 
would most likely still be alive, but the government will be at fault because of 
this STUPID FUCKING LAW!<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening...</p>

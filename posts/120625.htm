YouTube Channel - Entry 
Date: 12th June 2025</font></i></p>
<p>You heard me correctly. Before anyone thinks &quot;Oh you're never gonna get 
popular! You'll never get monetised!&quot; Stop. I'm thinking on doing it for fun. I 
don't care what the outcome is. I just want to make something that people might 
enjoy. Even if it's just played in the background, I don't care. Like I said, it 
is for fun. I don't want to get monetised. I will not be bound by YouTube's 
algorithm.</p>
<p>What I am planning on doing first is covering things from my collection. 
Including computers, phones and other nuggets. I may also record some cleaning 
and restoration videos.</p>
<p>I plan for the main camera to be a top down view of my desk. Similar to that 
of Dankpods' videos. However, That should be all similarities seen in his 
videos. Any other similarities are entirely accidental. For one, I intend my 
videos to be calm, and down-to-earth, unless for a skit. </p>
